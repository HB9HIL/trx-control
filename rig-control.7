.TH RIG-CONTROL 7 "8 September 2023" "rig-control"
.SH NAME
rig-control \- software to control radio transceivers
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
Software to control amateur radio transceivers.
.
.PP
rig-control consists of
.IR rigd (8)
(a daemon to control the transceiver), and,
.IR rigctl (1)
(a command line utility to access rigd.)
.
.
.IR rigd (8)
listens on port 14285 by for incoming connections
(14285 is the default port, it can be changed).
.
.PP
rig-control supports IPv4 and IPv6.
.
.PP
The effective transceiver control is done using Lua modules,
this way new transceivers can easily be supported by suppliying
a corresponding Lua module for a specific transceiver model.
See https://lua.org and https://lua.msys.ch for more information on Lua.
.
.
.SH "BACKGROUND"
.
rig-control is the base layer of a larger software system to
support contesting in "runner" and "search & pounce" mode where
a monitor station can enter heard stations into a queue (querying
.IR rigd (8)
for frequency an mode) and the "run & pounce" station
can either select a running frequency and mode or select a station
from the "stations heard" queue. By clicking or tapping on a
running frequency or an antry from the "stations heard" queue,
the transceiver will be tuned to that frequency using rigd(8).
.
.PP
Another client might be the contest logging software, which can
query
.IR rigd (8)
for the frequency and mode of the station that
is currently being worked.  We have plans to add rig-control
support to SkookumLogger.
.
.
.SH "SUPPORTED TRANSCEIVERS"
.PP
Initially, rig-control will support the following transceivers:

.
.SH "PROTOCOL"
.
The protocol between rigd(8) and a client will be simple, but
is not yet defined in its entity. In any case, one rigd(8)
daemon can serve an unlimited number of clients.  A client can
not only send commands to rigd(8), it can also subscribe for
events like frequency changed etc.
