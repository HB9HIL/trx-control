.TH TRX-CONTROL 7 "10 December 2023" "trx-control"
.SH NAME
trx-control \- software to control amateur radio transceivers
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
Software to control amateur radio transceivers and related hardware like
relays, GPIO pins, rotators.
.
.PP
trx-control consists of
.IR trxd (8)
(a daemon to control the transceivers and other hardware),
.IR trxctl (1)
(a command line utility to access trxd), and
.IR xqrg (1)
(a graphical client to display a transceivers frequency.)
.PP
.IR trxctl (1)
and
.IR xqrg (1)
ar meant as reference clients only.
Software that wants to make use of
.IR trxd (8)
should implement the protocol and talk to
.IR trxd (8)
directly over the network.
.
.
.PP
.IR trxd (8)
listens on port 14285 by default for incoming connections over
plain sockets and can optionally listen for WebSocket connections.

It supports both IPv4 and IPv6.
.
.PP
The effective transceiver control is done using Lua modules,
this way new transceivers can easily be supported by supplying
a corresponding Lua driver module for a specific transceiver model.
See https://lua.org and https://lua.msys.ch for more information on Lua.

.SH "SUPPORTED TRANSCEIVERS"

trx-control supports the following transceivers, more will be added over time:
