.TH TRX-CONTROL 7 "11 September 2023" "trx-control"
.SH NAME
trx-control \- software to control radio transceivers
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
Software to control amateur radio transceivers.
.
.PP
trx-control consists of
.IR trxd (8)
(a daemon to control the transceiver), and,
.IR trxctl (1)
(a command line utility to access trxd.)
.
.
.IR trxd (8)
listens on port 14285 by for incoming connections
(14285 is the default port, it can be changed).
.
.PP
trx-control supports IPv4 and IPv6.
.
.PP
The effective transceiver control is done using Lua modules,
this way new transceivers can easily be supported by suppliying
a corresponding Lua module for a specific transceiver model.
See https://lua.org and https://lua.msys.ch for more information on Lua.
.
.
.SH "BACKGROUND"
.
trx-control (pronounced "transceiver control") is the base layer of a
larger software system to support contesting in "runner" and "search & pounce"
mode where a monitor station can enter heard stations into a queue (querying
.IR trxd (8)
for frequency an mode) and the "run & pounce" station
can either select a running frequency and mode or select a station
from the "stations heard" queue. By clicking or tapping on a
running frequency or an antry from the "stations heard" queue,
the transceiver will be tuned to that frequency using trxd(8).
.
.PP
Another client might be the contest logging software, which can
query
.IR trxd (8)
for the frequency and mode of the station that is currently being worked.
.
.
.SH "SUPPORTED TRANSCEIVERS"
.PP
Initially, trx-control will support the following transceivers:
.

.
Make sure to set the CAT bit rate to the value expected by
.IR trxd (8) .
.
.
.SH "PROTOCOL"
.
The protocol between trxd(8) and a client will be simple, but
is not yet defined in its entity. In any case, one trxd(8)
daemon can serve an unlimited number of clients.  A client can
not only send commands to trxd(8), it can also subscribe for
events like frequency changed etc.
